# leftlib-pca
A PCA decomposition and plotting of ~40 political positions of people from a FB group.
All results were self-provided and obtained through answering the questionnaire available at https://8values.github.io/
The main file is leftlibpeople.py, annotation3D and rotanimate are just helper libraries to put dinamic labels and to create an animation, respectively.
leftlibpeople_mayavi makes the same but using the mlab plotting function.
